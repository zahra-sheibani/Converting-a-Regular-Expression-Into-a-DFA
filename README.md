# Converting-a-Regular-Expression-Into-a-DFA
This C++ program constructs a syntax tree from a user-defined regular expression, computes nullable, firstpos, lastpos, and followpos, and finally generates a DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton) transition table based on these attributes. The tree structure and input alphabet are user-driven.
